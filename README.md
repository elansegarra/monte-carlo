# MONTE-CARLO
Small library of functions and objects to help researchers quickly conduct more robust Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
When investigating the behavior of an estimation method it is often useful, if not necessary, to repeatedly run the method on synthetically generated data.

This package includes the ability to
 - Quickly run Monte Carlo simulations given a provided data generation procedure and estimation procedure.
 - Aggregate the results of the simulations along with various diagniostic statistics.
 - Check the stability of the MC estimates to help determine if more simulations should be conducted.
 - Retrieve and inspect individual simulations that merit closer attention.
